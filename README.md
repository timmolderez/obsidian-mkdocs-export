# obsidian-mkdocs-export (.. in development ..)
Export parts of your Obsidian vault to an MkDocs static website

On the to-do list / wishlist:
- [X] choose any page of an Obsidian vault as your starting point / homepage , and the static site generated from it will include everything reachable from that starting point
- [ ] if you end up accidentally capturing the whole graph this way, option to configure a maximum link distance/hops from the starting point
- [X] supports attachments being stored in a separate folder
- [ ] auto-renders any Excalidraw files to images (svg?) .. maybe add a link to the source file too
- [X] zero requirements on how you should use/format your Obsidian vault .. should just work
